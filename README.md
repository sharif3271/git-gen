# git-gen
an oh-my-zsh  plugin for handling bulk operations of git.
Actually for my self, every week I need to create and remove batch of branches. then I have written a function in zsh as an oh-my-zsh custom plugin.
Enjoy it!



## how to use
it is easy if you are using **oh-my-zsh**.
in your terminal:
```
cd $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
```
then
```
git clone https://github.com/sharif3271/git-gen.git
```
then edit .zshrc on ```$HOME/.zshrc```

```
plugins=(
  .
  .
  .
  git-gen
)

```
Done!!
